## 📖 Overview  
**GitTimeMachine** is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that gives AI assistants like **Claude Code** deep access to your Git history. It enables intelligent analysis of code changes, commit blame information, and **time-travel debugging** of files across commits.  

This makes your AI assistant not just a code helper, but a **true collaborator** in understanding the evolution of your codebase.
